# Lightfeather Submission

I am assuming that the only thing setup thus far is a Java JDK, version 8 or 11.

In LightfeatherSubmission-main\LightfeatherSubmission-main rename mvn to .mvn
Then, in the LightfeatherSubmission-main\LightfeatherSubmission-main directory (the directory with the mvnw.cmd file), run the following command: mvnw spring-boot:run
